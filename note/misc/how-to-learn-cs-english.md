# 如何学计算机专业英语

Highly recommend NOT to start with novels, unless you are interested in literacy anyway. You'll most likely be very frustrated and give up soon. Some non-fictions like [Steve Jobs](http://book.douban.com/subject/6512188/) and [In the Plex](http://book.douban.com/subject/4789228/) are very good, though. 

It needs a bit practice, but that's all. Go pick up an interesting CS book, read it, highlight it, take some notes, scribble a few words on the margins, etc. Just do it, 30min a day, for a few months. Remember, only read the best and the most interesting books. [TCPL](http://book.douban.com/subject/1236999/), [SICP](http://book.douban.com/subject/1451622/), [CLRS](http://book.douban.com/subject/3904676/), [CAQA](http://book.douban.com/subject/1984303/), [CMATH](http://book.douban.com/subject/1390010/), [CC2](http://book.douban.com/subject/1432042/), and even [TAOCP](http://book.douban.com/subject/1418402/) are all incredibly interesting and well-written. Pick one and throw months in it.

Write slides, like [this](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/people/jeff/WSDM09-keynote.pdf) and [this](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf). Writing technical slides is an amazing practice. With very limited space you have to use accurate words, concise sentences, and clear structures. Plus that you will find it an amazingly useful skill in future work. The other one is writing emails, by the way.

Read The [Elements of Style](http://book.douban.com/subject/1433835/), at least twice a year. If you do not have time, skip everything else and read this 100-page book.

It takes time, at best months and normally years. I saw no one successfully improved his/her language skills within a few weeks, including some very smart guys. The earlier you start, the earlier and more likely you will get there, and the more fun you will enjoy. That's it.

Hope this helps.
